    As the founding frontend engineer at Alma, I played a crucial role in
    the early conception and development of our platform. By embracing agile
    methodologies and quick iteration cycles, I helped transform initial
    product ideas into a functional and user-friendly platform within tight
    deadlines.


    Spearheaded the integration of automated testing frameworks, including unit and integration tests, into our development process. This initiative improved code stability, enhanced product quality, and reduced post-release bugs, leading to a smoother user experience and decreased maintenance costs.


    Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including backend developers, designers, and product managers, to align technical efforts with business goals.
